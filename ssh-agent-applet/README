ssh-agent-applet is a Gnome applet that allows you to conveniently keep your
ssh key(s) on external media. This means that if your computer is cracked or
stolen, the attacker will not have a copy of private ssh key(s).

Using ssh-agent-applet, your keys are loaded into ssh-agent as soon as you
insert your "key drive" into a USB port. The drive is automatically unmounted
once the key loaded so you can remove it from the USB port immediately.

See INSTALL for details of how to install and configure the applet.

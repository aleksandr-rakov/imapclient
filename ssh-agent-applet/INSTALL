To install (as root):

    -  run:
            python setup.py install

    - and then:
            post-install.sh

That's it. You may have to log out and log back in before the applet will
appear in the list of available panel applets.

To add to your panel:
    - right click a Gnome panel
    - click "Add to Panel"
    - select "SSH Agent Applet" in the list
    - click "Add"

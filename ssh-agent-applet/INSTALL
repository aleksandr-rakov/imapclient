Supported Platforms
-------------------
ssh-agent-applet is only useful to systems running Gnome or that can run Gnome
panel applets. It has only been tested on Linux systems. Feedback on installing on other platforms would be greatly appreciated.

Ensure that ssh-agent, HAL and DBUS are running
-----------------------------------------------
The applet is useless without a ssh-agent instance running under your account.
Many/most modern Linux distributions are already set up to start ssh-agent when
you log in via gdm so you shouldn't have to do anything.

To check if ssh-agent is running check the output of "ps x | grep ssh-agent".

ssh-agent-applet also relies on HAL and DBUS. These will already be in use on
most modern Linux distributions. Please ensure they are active.

Install ssh-agent-applet
------------------------
To install (as root) run:

    python setup.py install
    ./post-install.sh

That's it. You may have to log out and log back in before the applet will
appear in the list of available panel applets.

Adding ssh-agent-applet to a Gnome panel
----------------------------------------
1. Right click a Gnome panel.
2. Click "Add to Panel" on the popup menu.
3. Select "SSH Agent Applet" from the list.
4. Click "Add".

Configuring ssh-agent-applet
----------------------------
The preferences screen for the ssh-agent-applet can be accessed by
right-clicking the applet icon and selecting Preferences.

Setting up an USB thumbdrive for use with ssh-agent-applet
----------------------------------------------------------
Any USB thumbdrive or other removal media can be used with ssh-agent-applet. To
install your keys on a USB thumbdrive:

1. Your ssh key is normally found at ~/.ssh/id_rsa or ~/.ssh/id_dsa. If you
don't have an ssh key yet you can use ssh-keygen to create one. See the
ssh-keygen man page for more information. Remember to add a passphrase to the
key (see step 2).

2. Ensure your ssh key is protected by a pass-phrase. This is critical! If this
isn't done and someone steals or accesses your thumbdrive, they can copy and
use your private key and therefore access all machines that you have access to.

Use "ssh-keygen -p" if you have already generated a key but need to add a
passphrase.

3. Make a backup copy of your key. This shouldn't be on your computer and
should be kept somewhere secure and difficult to access.

4. Insert your USB thumbdrive. On a modern Linux system it should be
automatically mounted (perhaps under /media).

5. Move your key to the USB thumbdrive to one of the location configured in
the Search Paths preference. The default locations are ssh/id_rsa and
ssh/id_dsa.

6. Unmount the thumbdrive.

That should be it. When you next insert the thumbdrive, you will be prompted
for your key password. The key will then be loaded into ssh-agent and then the
drive will be unmounted.

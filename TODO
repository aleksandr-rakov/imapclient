- email JP Calderone re use of his code <exarkun at divmod com>

- make source repo available via HTTP

- automate releases with bzr

- look at paver to automate the release process more

- turn livetests into a nose based test
    - make each test independent

- clean up basic command handling to avoid repetition
- might be able to metaprogram the way out of the currently clumsy UID handling situation
- make it easy to run all tests when installed via easy_install

- transparent splitting of long message id lists 
	(some servers have limits on the number of messages ids)

- a bunch of stuff doesn't work with gmail's IMAP (see livetest.py)
- sphinx based docs
    - publish on web site too
- support for more IMAP functions: sort, examine etc
    - someone sent a patch for this?
- write a comparision of imaplib vs imapclient.py
	(presentation is a good start)
- use "mailbox" instead of "folder" to be consistent with RFCs
- higher level fetch methods for common or single attributes, flattened
- handling of read-only access
- more unit tests using mocking
- allow per-call uid overrides
- more docs
- better namespace support
- more complex authentication methods
- get rid of imaplib completely?
- support for streaming data in and out (via generators/file-like objects)
- FetchTokeniser breaks with nested lists
	(doesn't seem to cause real problems though)

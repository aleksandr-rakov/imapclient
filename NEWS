Version 0.5
-----------
Folder names are now encoded and decoded transparently if required (using
modified UTF-7). This means that any methods that return folder names may
return unicode objects as well as normal strings [API CHANGE]. Additionally,
any method that takes a folder name now accepts unicode object too. Use the
folder_encode attribute to control whether encode/decoding is performed.

Unquoted folder names in server responses are now handled correctly. Thanks
to Neil Martinsen-Burrell for reporting this bug.

Fixed a bug with handling of unusual characters in folder names.

Timezones are now handled correctly for datetimes passed as input and for
server responses. This fixes a number of bugs with timezones. Returned
datetimes are always in the client's local timezone [API CHANGE].

Many more unit tests, some using Michael Foord's excellent mock.py.
